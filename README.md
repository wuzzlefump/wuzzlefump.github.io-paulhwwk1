Paul's homework for the first week of a coding bootcamp

I was asked to modify an existing website so that :
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN they view the source code
THEN they find semantic HTML elements
WHEN they view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN they find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN they view the image elements
THEN they find accessible alt attributes
WHEN they view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN they view the title element
THEN they find a concise, descriptive title
So I changed the code tags so that was the case
there are comments throug out the code detailing the changes
